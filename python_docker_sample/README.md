# Python Docker sample

This is a sample project to build Flask application and deploy it using docker. Docker essentially works by reading a set of commands on `Dockerfile` and additional configuration in `docker-compose.yml`. Docker enables containerization to easily deploy app in any environment (environment-agnostic).
