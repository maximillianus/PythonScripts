# Problem A : Identifying anomaly in graphs

# Problem B : Detecting possible fraud in driver registration
Questions:
    1. Is there any anomaly in the data?
    2. Based on your answer, state the reasons!

Approach:
    - Check the data, explore, understand.

    - how do we know that there is a fraud?
    * existence of anomaly in the defined process could mean fraud

    - how do we know that there is anomaly?
    * anomaly is irregularity in the dataset/trend/usage/pattern.

    - what makes me think that there is an irregularity in a trend/usage/pattern?
    * because I see an unusual pattern that deviates away from common/normal pattern

    - what is the normal process/pattern in registration process?
    * Normal registration process can be identified after we plot pattern for each agents.
    -- How many driver ID is being registered over time for each agent?
    -- What is the common registration period for each agent?
    -- Is there possibly erroneous entry of driverID?

    - how many columns and rows are there?
    * 1037 rows & 3 columns
    * 1037 observations with 3 variables

    - what do all the columns mean?
    * cols: Agent Name, Timestamp, DriverID
    * each observation has unique driverID. this means that every observation is a completed registration of driver.
    * we can call this table/data as list of completed driver registration. each registration will have its own unique driverID,
      agent name who registers, and timestamp to indicated registration time.

    - is there any irregularity in the registration process?
    * Check common registration pattern for each agent and compare them all

    - Visualizing irregularity:
    * There seems to be a special pattern for fraud in this case
    * 1. registration is done on offdays ie. weekends.
    * 2. registration is done after work hours near midnight.
    * 3. driverID registered has consecutive number.
    * 4. multiple ID is registered in a very short time period (1-2secs)



# Problem C : Detecting possible fraud in GO-FOOD merchant
Questions: 
    1. is there any frauds observed?
    2. can elaborate any patterns of fraud?

Understanding Data:
    1. Data Shape
    * 248 rows and 18 columns

    2. what are each observations?
    * booking data with unique booking id each

    3. What are the columns/variables?
    * booking id
    * data date - date when data is logged? in integer, must convert
    * booking date - when booking happens
    * dispatch time - when driver is patched
    * closing time - when booking is completed
    * merchant name - 1 unique ie ABC
    * customer id & customer name - 46 unique
    * driver id & driver name - 39 unique
    * shopping estimated price - 7000 - 68000
    * origin longitude & latitude
    * destination longitude & latitude
    * total distance - 0.46 - 24.96km
    * origin note - 245 known, 3 unknown
    * destination address



Investigating Questions:
    1. Check time difference between booking date to dispatch time and dispatch time to closing time
