# Problem A : Identifying anomaly in graphs

# Problem B : Detecting possible fraud in driver registration
Questions:
    1. Is there any anomaly in the data?
    2. Based on your answer, state the reasons!

Approach:
    - Check the data, explore, understand.

    - how do we know that there is a fraud?
    * existence of anomaly in the defined process could mean fraud

    - how do we know that there is anomaly?
    * anomaly is irregularity in the dataset/trend/usage/pattern.

    - what makes me think that there is an irregularity in a trend/usage/pattern?
    * because I see an unusual pattern that deviates away from common/normal pattern

    - how many columns and rows are there?
    * 1037 rows & 3 columns
    * 1037 observations with 3 variables

    - what do all the columns mean?
    * cols: Agent Name, Timestamp, DriverID
    * each observation has unique driverID. this means that every observation is a completed registration of driver.
    * we can call this table/data as list of completed driver registration. each registration will have its own unique driverID,
      agent name who registers, and timestamp to indicated registration time.


    - what is the normal process/pattern in registration process?
    * we are trying to identify anomaly for the agents. Thus, plot the trend of agents' registration behavior
      over time.
    -- How many driver ID is being registered over time for each agent?
    -- What is the common registration period for each agent?
    -- Is there possibly erroneous entry of driverID?
    
    - is there any irregularity in the registration process?
    * Check common registration pattern for each agent and compare them all
